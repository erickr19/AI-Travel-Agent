# Time log for AI-Travel-Agent
### Daily development logs/journal
#### 4/10
Started experimenting with OpenAI's API to see what I could make. Came up with the idea to make a
web application where a user can query the AI to create travel plans. I then began designing the front
end for the project. I've though of how to incorporate CRUD functionality into the project, and I've come up
with the following:
###### Create

- User can create an itinerary using AI API call
- User has the option to regenerate the itinerary or save it to profile

###### Read

- User can read their saved itineraries from the database

###### Update

- User can update their itinerary and write their own information that the AI couldn't account for:
- Budget
- Time
- Etc.

###### Delete

- User can delete their itineraries if they change their mind of the trip
